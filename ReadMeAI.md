## Modules

The repository is organized into seven modules, each covering a different topic and technique of AI. Each module contains a README file that explains the objectives, concepts, and tasks of the module. The modules are:

### Module 1: Search and Optimization

This module introduces the concepts and algorithms of search and optimization, such as uninformed search, informed search, local search, genetic algorithms, etc. The tasks include implementing and comparing different search algorithms on various problems, such as the 8-puzzle, the traveling salesman problem, the n-queens problem, etc.

### Module 2: Logic and Reasoning

This module introduces the concepts and tools of logic and reasoning, such as propositional logic, first-order logic, inference rules, resolution, etc. The tasks include implementing and applying different logic systems and inference methods on various problems, such as the wumpus world, the blocks world, the sudoku puzzle, etc.

### Module 3: Artificial Neural Networks

This module introduces the concepts and architectures of artificial neural networks, such as perceptrons, multilayer perceptrons, backpropagation, activation functions, etc. The tasks include implementing and training different neural network models on various datasets, such as the iris dataset, the MNIST dataset, the XOR problem, etc.

### Module 4: Deep Learning

This module introduces the concepts and frameworks of deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. The tasks include building and testing different deep learning models on various problems, such as image classification, sentiment analysis, text generation, etc.

### Module 5: Natural Language Processing

This module introduces the concepts and techniques of natural language processing, such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, etc. The tasks include implementing and using different natural language processing methods on various tasks, such as text summarization, machine translation, question answering, etc.

### Module 6: Computer Vision

This module introduces the concepts and applications of computer vision, such as image processing, feature extraction, face detection, object recognition, etc. The tasks include implementing and using different computer vision algorithms on various problems, such as edge detection, corner detection, face recognition, scene recognition, etc.

### Module 7: Robotics

This module introduces the concepts and challenges of robotics, such as robot anatomy, kinematics, dynamics, control, localization, mapping, planning, etc. The tasks include simulating and programming different robots on various scenarios, such as a robot arm, a mobile robot, a humanoid robot, etc.

## Projects

The repository also contains two projects that require the integration and application of multiple AI techniques and tools. Each project contains a README file that describes the problem statement, the data sources, the evaluation metrics, and the deliverables. The projects are:

- Project 1: Chatbot
  - The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot that can interact with users in natural language and provide useful information or services. The chatbot can be domain-specific or domain-general, depending on the choice and preference of the students.
- Project 2: Game AI
  - The goal of this project is to develop a game AI that can play a video game or a board game against human or computer opponents. The game AI can use any AI technique or framework, depending on the complexity and requirements of the game.

## Resources

The following resources can help you learn more about AI and its applications:

- [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](^1^): A textbook that covers the theory and practice of AI, written by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.
- [AI Chat](^2^): A tool that lets you generate text and code using artificial intelligence. You can choose from different AI modes to suit your needs, such as summarizing, debating, translating, or creating stories and messages.
- [Artificial intelligence - Wikipedia](^3^): A comprehensive article that covers the history, goals, approaches, applications, and challenges of AI.
- [About - OpenAI](^4^): A website of a nonprofit organization that aims to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. You can learn about their mission, vision, research, products, and careers in AI.
