Artificial Intelligence üåêü§ñ
This repository contains the code and data for the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory course of my college. The course covers various topics and techniques of AI, such as search and optimization, logic and reasoning, artificial neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, etc. The repository is organized into different folders, each corresponding to a different module or project of the course. The README files in each folder provide the instructions and details for running the code and using the data. The repository also includes some examples and resources for learning more about AI.
